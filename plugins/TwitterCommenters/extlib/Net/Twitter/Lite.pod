=head1 NAME

Net::Twitter::Lite - A perl interface to the Twitter API

=head1 VERSION

version 0.12004

=head1 STOP!

You probably want L<Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1> which has support for
Twitter API v1.1. If you're using a service with an API compatible with
Twitter's deprecated API v1, then you're in the right place.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Twitter::Lite;

  my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(
      username => $user,
      password => $password
      legacy_lists_api => 0,
  );

  my $result = eval { $nt->update('Hello, world!') };

  eval {
      my $statuses = $nt->friends_timeline({ since_id => $high_water, count => 100 });
      for my $status ( @$statuses ) {
          print "$status->{created_at} <$status->{user}{screen_name}> $status->{text}\n";
      }
  };
  warn "$@\n" if $@;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a perl interface to the Twitter API v1.

It uses the same API definitions as L<Net::Twitter>, but without the extra
bells and whistles and without the additional dependencies.  Same great taste,
less filling.

This module is related to, but is not part of the C<Net::Twitter>
distribution.  It's API methods and API method documentation are generated
from C<Net::Twitter>'s internals.  It exists for those who cannot, or prefer
not to install L<Moose> and its dependencies.

You should consider upgrading to C<Net::Twitter> for additional functionality,
finer grained control over features, backwards compatibility with older
versions of C<Net::Twitter>, and additional error handling options.

=head1 CLIENT CODE CHANGES REQUIRED

=head2 Legacy Lists API

Twitter re-implemented the Lists API using new endpoints and semantics. For backwards
compatibility, this version of C<Net::Twitter::Lite> defaults to the deprecated, legacy
endpoints and semantics.  It issues a warning if the C<legacy_lists_api> option to new
is not provided.

To enable the new Lists endpoints and semantics, pass C<(legacy_lists_api => 0)> to
C<new>.  To disable the warning, and keep the backwards compatible endpoints and
semantics, pass C<(legacy_lists_api => 1)> to C<new>.

The C<legacy_lists_api> option to C<new> sets the default for all lists API method
calls.  You can override the default an each API call by passing a C<-legacy_lists_api>
option set to 1 or 0.

Support for C<legacy_lists_api> option will be removed in a future version and the
option to C<new> will be silently ignored.

=head2 netrc option

The default C<apiurl> changed in version 0.08006.  The change should be
transparent to client code, unless you're using the C<netrc> option.  If so,
you'll need to either update the C<.netrc> entry and change the C<machine>
value from C<twitter.com> to C<api.twitter.com>, or set either the C<netrc>
or C<netrc_machine> options to C<twitter.com>.

    $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc_machine => 'twitter.com', netrc => 1);
    # -or-
    $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc => 'twitter.com');

=head2 OAuth requires callback parameter

Beginning with version 0.03, it is necessary for web applications using OAuth
authentication to pass the C<callback> parameter to C<get_authorization_url>.
In the absence of a callback parameter, when the user authorizes the
application a PIN number is displayed rather than redirecting the user back to
your site.

=head1 MIGRATING FROM NET::TWITTER 2.x

If you are migrating from Net::Twitter 2.12 (or an earlier version), you may
need to make some minor changes to your application code in order to user
Net::Twitter::Lite successfully.

The primary difference is in error handling.  Net::Twitter::Lite throws
exceptions on error.  It does not support the C<get_error>, C<http_code>, and
C<http_message> methods used in Net::Twitter 2.12 and prior versions.

Instead of

  # DON'T!
  my $friends = $nt->friends();
  if ( $friends ) {
      # process $friends
  }

wrap the API call in an eval block:

  # DO!
  my $friends = eval { $nt->friends() };
  if ( $friends ) {
      # process $friends
  }

Here's a much more complex example taken from application code using
Net::Twitter 2.12:

  # DON'T!
  my $friends = $nt->friends();
  if ( $friends ) {
      # process $friends
  }
  else {
      my $error = $nt->get_error;
      if ( ref $error ) {
          if ( ref($error) eq 'HASH' && exists $error->{error} ) {
              $error = $error->{error};
          }
          else {
              $error = 'Unexpected error type ' . ref($error);
          }
      }
      else {
          $error = $nt->http_code() . ": " . $nt->http_message;
      }
      warn "$error\n";
  }

The Net::Twitter::Lite equivalent is:

  # DO!
  eval {
      my $friends = $nt->friends();
      # process $friends
  };
  warn "$@\n" if $@;
  return;

In Net::Twitter::Lite, an error can always be treated as a string.  See
L<Net::Twitter::Lite::Error>.  The HTTP Status Code and HTTP Message are both
available.  Rather than accessing them via the Net::Twitter::Lite instance,
you access them via the Net::Twitter::Lite::Error instance thrown as an error.

For example:

  # DO!
  eval {
     my $friends = $nt->friends();
     # process $friends
  };
  if ( my $error = $@ ) {
      if ( blessed $error && $error->isa("Net::Twitter::Lite::Error)
           && $error->code() == 502 ) {
          $error = "Fail Whale!";
      }
      warn "$error\n";
  }

=head2 Unsupported Net::Twitter 2.12 options to C<new>

Net::Twitter::Lite does not support the following Net::Twitter 2.12 options to
C<new>.  It silently ignores them:

=over 4

=item no_fallback

If Net::Twitter::Lite is unable to create an instance of the class specified in
the C<useragent_class> option to C<new>, it dies, rather than falling back to
an LWP::UserAgent object.  You really don't want a failure to create the
C<useragent_class> you specified to go unnoticed.

=item twittervision

Net::Twitter::Lite does not support the TwitterVision API.  Use Net::Twitter,
instead, if you need it.

=item skip_arg_validation

Net::Twitter::Lite does not API parameter validation.  This is a feature.  If
Twitter adds a new option to an API method, you can use it immediately by
passing it in the HASH ref to the API call.

Net::Twitter::Lite relies on Twitter to validate its own parameters.  An
appropriate exception will be thrown if Twitter reports a parameter error.

=item die_on_validation

See L</skip_arg_validation>.  If Twitter returns an bad parameter error, an
appropriate exception will be thrown.

=item arrayref_on_error

This option allowed the following idiom in Net::Twitter 2.12:

  # DON'T!
  for my $friend ( @{ $nt->friends() } ) {
     # process $friend
  }

The equivalent Net::Twitter::Lite code is:

  # DO!
  eval {
      for my $friend ( @{ $nt->friends() } ) {
          # process $friend
      }
  };

=back

=head2 Unsupported Net::Twitter 2.12 methods

=over 4

=item clone

The C<clone> method was added to Net::Twitter 2.x to allow safe error handling
in an environment where concurrent requests are handled, for example, when
using LWP::UserAgent::POE as the C<useragent_class>.  Since Net::Twitter::Lite
throws exceptions instead of stashing them in the Net::Twitter::Lite instance,
it is safe in a current request environment, obviating the need for C<clone>.

=item get_error

=item http_code

=item http_message

These methods are replaced by Net::Twitter::Lite::Error.  An instance of that
class is thrown errors are encountered.

=back

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item new

This constructs a C<Net::Twitter::Lite> object.  It takes several named parameters,
all of them optional:

=item oauth_urls

A HASH ref of URLs to be used with OAuth authentication. Defaults to:

  {
      request_token_url => "http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token",
      authorization_url => "http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize",
      access_token_url  => "http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token",
      xauth_url         => "https://twitter.com/oauth/access_token",
  }

=item clientname

The value for the C<X-Twitter-Client-Name> HTTP header. It defaults to "Perl
Net::Twitter::Lite".

=item clientver

The value for the C<X-Twitter-Client-Version> HTTP header. It defaults to
current version of the C<Net::Twitter::Lite> module.

=item clienturl

The value for the C<X-Twitter-Client-URL> HTTP header. It defaults to the
search.cpan.org page for the C<Net::Twitter::Lite> distribution.

=item useragent_class

The C<LWP::UserAgent> compatible class used internally by C<Net::Twitter::Lite>.  It
defaults to "LWP::UserAgent".  For L<POE> based applications, consider using
"LWP::UserAgent::POE".

=item useragent_args

An HASH ref of arguments to pass to constructor of the class specified with
C<useragent_class>, above.  It defaults to {} (an empty HASH ref).

=item useragent

The value for C<User-Agent> HTTP header.  It defaults to
"Net::Twitter::Lite/0.11002 (Perl)".

=item source

The value used in the C<source> parameter of API method calls. It is currently
only used in the C<update> method in the REST API.  It defaults to
"twitterpm".  This results in the text "from Net::Twitter" rather than "from
web" for status messages posted from C<Net::Twitter::Lite> when displayed via the
Twitter web interface.  The value for this parameter is provided by Twitter
when a Twitter application is registered.  See
L<http://apiwiki.twitter.com/FAQ#HowdoIget%E2%80%9CfromMyApp%E2%80%9DappendedtoupdatessentfrommyAPIapplication>.

=item apiurl

The URL for the Twitter API. This defaults to "http://twitter.com".

=item identica

If set to 1 (or any value that evaluates to true), apiurl defaults to
"http://identi.ca/api".

=item ssl

If set to 1, an SSL connection will be used for all API calls. Defaults to 0.

=item netrc

(Optional) Sets the I<machine> key to look up in C<.netrc> to obtain
credentials. If set to 1, Net::Twitter::Lite will use the value of the C<netrc_machine>
option (below).

   # in .netrc
   machine api.twitter.com
     login YOUR_TWITTER_USER_NAME
     password YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD
   machine semifor.twitter.com
     login semifor
     password SUPERSECRET

   # in your perl program
   $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc => 1);
   $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc => 'semifor.twitter.com');

=item netrc_machine

(Optional) Sets the C<machine> entry to look up in C<.netrc> when C<<netrc => 1>>
is used.  Defaults to C<api.twitter.com>.

=item legacy_lists_api

If set to 1, this option enables backwards compatibility by using the now deprecated
endpoints and semantics for lists API methods. If set to 0, the new endpoints and
semantics will be used. Only the new lists API methods are documented here.

If you do not provide this option to C<new> a warning is issued. Support for
this option and the legacy lists API methods will be removed in a future version.

=head2 BASIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS

=over 4

=item credentials($username, $password)

Set the credentials for Basic Authentication.  This is helpful for managing
multiple accounts.

=back

=head2 OAUTH METHODS

=over 4

=item authorized

Whether the client has the necessary credentials to be authorized.

Note that the credentials may be wrong and so the request may fail.

=item request_access_token

Returns list including the access token, access token secret, user_id, and
screen_name for this user. Takes a HASH of arguments. The C<verifier> argument
is required.  See L</OAUTH EXAMPLES>.

The user must have authorized this app at the url given by C<get_authorization_url> first.

For desktop applications, the Twitter authorization page will present the user
with a PIN number.  Prompt the user for the PIN number, and pass it as the
C<verifier> argument to request_access_token.

Returns the access token and access token secret but also sets them internally
so that after calling this method, you can immediately call API methods
requiring authentication.

=item get_authorization_url(callback => $callback_url)

Get the URL used to authorize the user.  Returns a C<URI> object.  For web
applications, pass your applications callback URL as the C<callback> parameter.
No arguments are required for desktop applications (C<callback> defaults to
C<oob>, out-of-band).

=item get_authentication_url(callback => $callback_url)

Get the URL used to authenticate the user with "Sign in with Twitter"
authentication flow.  Returns a C<URI> object.  For web applications, pass your
applications callback URL as the C<callback> parameter.  No arguments are
required for desktop applications (C<callback> defaults to C<oob>, out-of-band).

=item xauth($username, $password)

Exchanges a username and password for OAuth tokens. Your application must be
approved for XAuth access by Twitter for this method to work.  Twitter does not
grant XAuth access for web applications except for a brief period of time to
allow them to switch form Basic authentication to OAuth authentication.

=item access_token

Get or set the access token.

=item access_token_secret

Get or set the access token secret.

=item request_token

Get or set the request token.

=item request_token_secret

Get or set the request token secret.

=item access_token_url

Get or set the access_token URL.

=item authentication_url

Get or set the authentication URL.

=item authorization_url

Get or set the authorization URL.

=item request_token_url

Get or set the request_token URL.

=item xauth_url

Get or set the XAuth access token request URL.

=back

=head1 API METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

Most Twitter API methods take parameters.  All Net::Twitter::Lite API
methods will accept a HASH ref of named parameters as specified in the Twitter
API documentation.  For convenience, many Net::Twitter::Lite methods accept
simple positional arguments as documented, below.  The positional parameter
passing style is optional; you can always use the named parameters in a hash
ref if you prefer.

For example, the REST API method C<update> has one required parameter,
C<status>.  You can call C<update> with a HASH ref argument:

    $nt->update({ status => 'Hello world!' });

Or, you can use the convenient form:

    $nt->update('Hello world!');

The C<update> method also has an optional parameter, C<in_reply_to_status_id>.
To use it, you B<must> use the HASH ref form:

    $nt->update({ status => 'Hello world!', in_reply_to_status_id => $reply_to });

Convenience form is provided for the required parameters of all API methods.
So, these two calls are equivalent:

    $nt->friendship_exists({ user_a => $fred, user_b => $barney });
    $nt->friendship_exists($fred, $barney);

Many API methods have aliases.  You can use the API method name, or any of its
aliases, as you prefer.  For example, these calls are all equivalent:

    $nt->friendship_exists($fred, $barney);
    $nt->relationship_exists($fred, $barney);
    $nt->follows($fred, $barney);

Aliases support both the HASH ref and convenient forms:

    $nt->follows({ user_a => $fred, user_b => $barney });

Methods that support the C<page> parameter expect page numbers E<gt> 0.  Twitter silently
ignores invalid C<page> values.  So C<< { page => 0 } >> produces the same result
as C<< { page => 1 } >>.

In addition to the arguments specified for each API method described below, an
additional C<authenticate> parameter can be passed.  To request an
C<Authorization> header, pass C<< authenticated => 1 >>; to suppress an
authentication header, pass C<< authentication => 0 >>.  Even if requested, an
Authorization header will not be added if there are no user credentials
(username and password for Basic Authentication; access tokens for OAuth).

This is probably only useful for the L</rate_limit_status> method in the REST
API, since it returns different values for an authenticated and a
non-authenticated call.

=head1 REST API Methods

Several of these methods accept a user ID as the C<id> parameter.  The user ID
can be either a screen name, or the users numeric ID.  To disambiguate, use
the C<screen_name> or C<user_id> parameters, instead.

For example, These calls are equivalent:

    $nt->create_friend('perl_api');    # screen name
    $nt->create_friend(1564061);       # numeric ID
    $nt->create_friend({ id => 'perl_api' });
    $nt->create_friend({ screen_name => 'perl_api' });
    $nt->create_friend({ user_id     => 1564061 });

However user_id 911 and screen_name 911 are separate Twitter accounts.  These
calls are NOT equivalent:

    $nt->create_friend(911); # interpreted as screen name
    $nt->create_friend({ user_id => 911 }); # screen name: richellis

Whenever the C<id> parameter is required and C<user_id> and C<screen_name> are
also parameters, using any one of them satisfies the requirement.

parameter to -1 to get the first page of IDs.  Set it to the prior return's
value of C<previous_cursor> or C<next_cursor> to page forward or backwards.
When there are no prior pages, the value of C<previous_cursor> will be 0.  When
there are no subsequent pages, the value of C<next_cursor> will be 0.


Returns: HashRef|ArrayRef[Int]

=item B<friends_ids>

=item B<friends_ids(id)>


=item alias: following_ids


=over 4

=item Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name, cursor

=item Required: id

=back

Returns a reference to an array of numeric IDs for every user followed by the
specified user. The order of the IDs is reverse chronological.

Use the optional C<cursor> parameter to retrieve IDs in pages of 5000.  When
the C<cursor> parameter is used, the return value is a reference to a hash with
keys C<previous_cursor>, C<next_cursor>, and C<ids>.  The value of C<ids> is a
reference to an array of IDS of the user's friends. Set the optional C<cursor>
parameter to -1 to get the first page of IDs.  Set it to the prior return's
value of C<previous_cursor> or C<next_cursor> to page forward or backwards.
When there are no prior pages, the value of C<previous_cursor> will be 0.  When
there are no subsequent pages, the value of C<next_cursor> will be 0.

=over 4

=item Parameters: user_id_a, user_id_b, screen_name_a, screen_name_b, user_a, user_b

=item Required: user_a, user_b

=back

Tests for the existence of friendship between two users. Will return true if
user_a follows user_b, otherwise will return false.

Use of C<user_a> and C<user_b> is deprecated.  It has been preserved for backwards
compatibility, and is used for the two-argument positional form:

    $nt->friendship_exists($user_a, $user_b);

Instead, you should use one of the named argument forms:

    $nt->friendship_exists({ user_id_a => $id1, user_id_b => $id2 });
    $nt->friendship_exists({ screen_name_a => $name1, screen_name_b => $name2 });

Consider using C<show_friendship> instead.

=item Parameters: lat, long, query, ip, granularity, accuracy, max_results, contained_within, attribute:street_address, callback

=item Required: I<none>

=back

Search for places that can be attached to a statuses/update. Given a latitude
and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this request will return a list
of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating a
status.

Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of
places, have the user validate the location he or she is at, and then send the
ID of this location with a call to statuses/update.

This is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to
statuses/update. Unlike geo/reverse_geocode which provides raw data access,
this endpoint can potentially re-order places with regards to the user who
is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for interactive place
matching with the user.

a radius in meters, but it can also take a string that is suffixed with ft to
specify feet.  If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m.  If
coming from a device, in practice, this value is whatever accuracy the device
has measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS, WiFi

=item B<update_profile_background_image(image)>



=over 4

=item Parameters: image, use

=item Required: image

=back

Updates the authenticating user's profile background image. The C<image>
parameter must be an arrayref with the same interpretation as the C<image>
parameter in the C<update_profile_image> method.  The C<use> parameter allows
you to specify whether to use the  uploaded profile background or not. See
that method's documentation for details.


Returns: ExtendedUser

=item B<update_profile_colors>



=over 4

=item Parameters: profile_background_color, profile_text_color, profile_link_color, profile_sidebar_fill_color, profile_sidebar_border_color

=item Required: I<none>

=back

Sets one or more hex values that control the color scheme of the
authenticating user's profile page on twitter.com.  These values are
also returned in the /users/show API method.


Returns: ExtendedUser

=item B<update_profile_image>

=item B<update_profile_image(image)>



=over 4

=item Parameters: image

=item Required: image

=back

Updates the authenticating user's profile image.  The C<image> parameter is an
arrayref with the following interpretation:

  [ $file ]
  [ $file, $filename ]
  [ $file, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type ]
  [ undef, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type, Content => $raw_image_data ]

The first value of the array (C<$file>) is the name of a file to open.  The
second value (C<$filename>) is the name given to Twitter for the file.  If
C<$filename> is not provided, the basename portion of C<$file> is used.  If
C<$mime_type> is not provided, it will be provided automatically using
L<LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type()>.

C<$raw_image_data> can be provided, rather than opening a file, by passing
C<undef> as the first array value.


Returns: ExtendedUser

=item B<update_with_media>

=item B<update_with_media(status, media)>



=over 4

=item Parameters: status, media[], possibly_sensitive, in_reply_to_status_id, lat, long, place_id, display_coordinates

=item Required: status, media

=back

Updates the authenticating user's status and attaches media for upload.

The C<media[]> parameter is an arrayref with the following interpretation:

  [ $file ]
  [ $file, $filename ]
  [ $file, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type ]
  [ undef, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type, Content => $raw_image_data ]

The first value of the array (C<$file>) is the name of a file to open.  The
second value (C<$filename>) is the name given to Twitter for the file.  If
C<$filename> is not provided, the basename portion of C<$file> is used.  If
C<$mime_type> is not provided, it will be provided automatically using
L<LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type()>.

C<$raw_image_data> can be provided, rather than opening a file, by passing
C<undef> as the first array value.

The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will reduce
the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s) cannot be
appended without text truncation, the tweet will be rejected and this method
will return an HTTP 403 error. 


Returns: Status

=item B<user_suggestions>

=item B<user_suggestions(category)>


=item alias: follow_suggestions


=over 4

=item Parameters: category, lang

=item Required: category

=back

Access the users in a given category of the Twitter suggested user list and
return their most recent status if they are not a protected user. Currently
supported values for optional parameter C<lang> are C<en>, C<fr>, C<de>, C<es>,
C<it>.  Does not require authentication.


Returns: ArrayRef

=item B<user_timeline>

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

When C<Net::Twitter::Lite> encounters a Twitter API error or a network error, it
throws a C<Net::Twitter::Lite::Error> object.  You can catch and process these
exceptions by using C<eval> blocks and testing $@:

    eval {
        my $statuses = $nt->friends_timeline(); # this might die!

        for my $status ( @$statuses ) {
            #...
        }
    };
    if ( $@ ) {
        # friends_timeline encountered an error

        if ( blessed $@ && $@->isa('Net::Twitter::Lite::Error' ) {
            #... use the thrown error obj
            warn $@->error;
        }
        else {
            # something bad happened!
            die $@;
        }
    }

C<Net::Twitter::Lite::Error> stringifies to something reasonable, so if you don't need
detailed error information, you can simply treat $@ as a string:

    eval { $nt->update($status) };
    if ( $@ ) {
        warn "update failed because: $@\n";
    }


=head1 AUTHENTICATION

Net::Twitter::Lite currently supports both Basic Authentication and OAuth.  The
choice of authentication strategies is determined by the options passed to
C<new> or the use of the C<credentials> method.  An error will be thrown if
options for both strategies are provided.

=head2 BASIC AUTHENTICATION

To use Basic Authentication, pass the C<username> and C<password> options to
C<new>, or call C<credentials> to set them.  When Basic Authentication is used,
the C<Authorization> header is set on each authenticated API call.

=head2 OAUTH AUTHENTICATION

To use OAuth authentication, pass the C<consumer_key> and C<consumer_secret> options to new.

L<Net::OAuth::Simple> must be installed in order to use OAuth and an error will
be thrown if OAuth is attempted without it.  Net::Twitter::Lite does not
I<require> Net::OAuth::Simple, making OAuth an optional feature.

=head2 OAUTH EXAMPLES

See the C<examples> directory included in this distribution for full working
examples using OAuth.

Here's how to authorize users as a desktop app mode:

  use Net::Twitter::Lite;

  my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(
      consumer_key    => "YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY",
      consumer_secret => "YOUR-CONSUMER-SECRET",
  );

  # You'll save the token and secret in cookie, config file or session database
  my($access_token, $access_token_secret) = restore_tokens();
  if ($access_token && $access_token_secret) {
      $nt->access_token($access_token);
      $nt->access_token_secret($access_token_secret);
  }

  unless ( $nt->authorized ) {
      # The client is not yet authorized: Do it now
      print "Authorize this app at ", $nt->get_authorization_url, " and enter the PIN#\n";

      my $pin = <STDIN>; # wait for input
      chomp $pin;

      my($access_token, $access_token_secret, $user_id, $screen_name) =
          $nt->request_access_token(verifier => $pin);
      save_tokens($access_token, $access_token_secret); # if necessary
  }

  # Everything's ready

In a web application mode, you need to save the oauth_token and
oauth_token_secret somewhere when you redirect the user to the OAuth
authorization URL.

  sub twitter_authorize : Local {
      my($self, $c) = @_;

      my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(%param);
      my $url = $nt->get_authorization_url(callback => $callbackurl);

      $c->response->cookies->{oauth} = {
          value => {
              token => $nt->request_token,
              token_secret => $nt->request_token_secret,
          },
      };

      $c->response->redirect($url);
  }

And when the user returns back, you'll reset those request token and
secret to upgrade the request token to access token.

  sub twitter_auth_callback : Local {
      my($self, $c) = @_;

      my %cookie = $c->request->cookies->{oauth}->value;

      my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(%param);
      $nt->request_token($cookie{token});
      $nt->request_token_secret($cookie{token_secret});
      my $verifier = $c->req->param->{oauth_verifier};

      my($access_token, $access_token_secret, $user_id, $screen_name) =
          $nt->request_access_token(verifier => $verifier);

      # Save $access_token and $access_token_secret in the database associated with $c->user
  }

Later on, you can retrieve and reset those access token and secret
before calling any Twitter API methods.

  sub make_tweet : Local {
      my($self, $c) = @_;

      my($access_token, $access_token_secret) = ...;

      my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(%param);
      $nt->access_token($access_token);
      $nt->access_token_secret($access_token_secret);

      # Now you can call any Net::Twitter::Lite API methods on $nt
      my $status = $c->req->param('status');
      my $res = $nt->update({ status => $status });
  }
