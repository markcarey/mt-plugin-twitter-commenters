=head1 NAME

Net::Twitter - Perl interface to twitter.com

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Net::Twitter version 2.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   #!/usr/bin/perl

   use Net::Twitter;

   my $twit = Net::Twitter->new(username=>"myuser", password=>"mypass" );

   my $result = $twit->update(status => "My current Status");

   my $twit->credentials("otheruser", "otherpass");

   my $result = $twit->update(status => "Status for otheruser");

   my $result = $twitter->search('Albi the racist dragon');

   foreach my $tweet (@{ $results }) {
     my $speaker =  $tweet->{from_user};
     my $text = $tweet->{text};
     my $time = $tweet->{created_at};
     print "$time <$speaker> $text\n";
   }

    my $steve = $twitter->search('Steve');
    $twitter->update($steve .'? Who is steve?');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

http://www.twitter.com provides a web 2.0 type of ubiquitous presence.
This module allows you to set your status, as well as review the statuses of
your friends.

You can view the latest status of Net::Twitter on it's own twitter timeline
at http://twitter.com/net_twitter

=over

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

Listed below are the methods available through the object.

Please note that any method that takes a hashref as an argument must be called
in the form:

    $twit->method({arg => "value"});

    and not

    $twit->method(arg => "value");

If the curly brackets around the arguments are missing, the code which implements the
convenience methods allowing you to specify a single argument as a string will interpret
"arg" as your argument.

=item C<new(...)>

You must supply a hash containing the configuration for the connection.

Valid configuration items are:

=over

=item C<username>

Username of your account at twitter.com. This is usually your email address.
"user" is an alias for "username".  REQUIRED.

=item C<password>

Password of your account at twitter.com. "pass" is an alias for "password"
REQUIRED.

=item C<useragent>

OPTIONAL: Sets the User Agent header in the HTTP request. If omitted, this will default to
"Net::Twitter/$Net::Twitter::Version (Perl)"

=item C<useragent_class>

OPTIONAL: An L<LWP::UserAgent> compatible class, e.g., L<LWP::UserAgent::POE>.
If omitted, this will default to L<LWP::UserAgent>.

=item C<no_fallback>

OPTIONAL: If a C<useragent_class> is specified but fails to load, the default behavior is
to warn and fall back to using regular L<LWP::UserAgent>. If C<no_fallback> is set to a boolean true
value, the C<new> method will cause the code to C<die>

=item C<source>

OPTIONAL: Sets the source name, so messages will appear as "from <source>" instead
of "from web". Defaults to displaying "Perl Net::Twitter". Note: see Twitter FAQ,
your client source needs to be included at twitter manually.

This value will be a code which is assigned to you by Twitter. For example, the
default value is "twitterpm", which causes Twitter to display the "from Perl
Net::Twitter" in your timeline. 

Twitter claims that specifying a nonexistant code will cause the system to default to
"from web". If you don't have a code from twitter, don't set one.

=item C<clientname>

OPTIONAL: Sets the X-Twitter-Client-Name: HTTP Header. If omitted, this defaults to
"Perl Net::Twitter"

=item C<clientver>

OPTIONAL: Sets the X-Twitter-Client-Version: HTTP Header. If omitted, this defaults to
the current Net::Twitter version, $Net::Twitter::VERSION.

=item C<clienturl>

OPTIONAL: Sets the X-Twitter-Client-URL: HTTP Header. If omitted, this defaults to
C<http://www.net-twitter.info>.

=item C<apiurl>

OPTIONAL. The URL of the API for twitter.com. This defaults to 
C<http://twitter.com/> if not set.

=item C<apihost>

=item C<apirealm>

OPTIONAL: If you do point to a different URL, you will also need to set C<apihost> and
C<apirealm> so that the internal LWP can authenticate. 

C<apihost> defaults to C<www.twitter.com:80>.

C<apirealm> defaults to C<Twitter API>.

=item C<identica>

OPTIONAL: Passing a true value for identica to new() will preset values for C<apiurl>, C<apirealm> and
C<apihost> which will point at the http://identi.ca twitter compatible API. 

All methods in Net::Twitter work as documented, except where listed in the 
identica/laconica documentation at:

L<http://laconi.ca/trac/wiki/TwitterCompatibleAPI>

For simplicity, you can also use L<Net::Identica> in your script instead of Net::Twitter, which
will default to identica being set to true.

=item C<twittervision>

OPTIONAL: If the C<twittervision> argument is passed with a true value, the
module will enable use of the L<http://www.twittervision.com> API. If
enabled, the C<show_user> method will include relevant location data in
its response hashref. Also, the C<update_twittervision> method will
allow setting of the current location.

=item C<skip_arg_validation>

OPTIONAL: Beginning in 2.00, Net::Twitter will validate arguments passed to the various API methods, 
flagging required args that were not passed, and discarding args passed that do not exist in the API 
specification. Passing a boolean True for skip_arg_validation into new() will skip this validation
process entirely and allow requests to proceed regardless of the args passed. This defaults to false.

=item C<die_on_validation>

OPTIONAL: In the event that the arguments passed to a method do not pass the validation process listed
above, the default action will be to warn the user, make the error readable through the get_error method
listed below, and to return undef to the caller. Passing a boolean true value for die_on_validation to
new() will change this behavior to simply executing a die() with the appropriate error message. This
defaults to false.

=item C<arrayref_on_error>

OPTIONAL: By default any methods which find an error, whether from twitter or from bad args, will 
return undef. Passing C<arrayref_on_error> as a boolean TRUE to new() will cause all error states to
return an empty arrayref instead. As most successful responses are in the form of arrayrefs, this will
cause a uniform response type for all calls. All error messages and codes are still available with
methods such as C<get_error>.

=back

=item C<clone()>

Returns a shallow copy of the Net::Twitter object. This can be used when Net::Twitter is used in 
a Parallel or Asynchronous framework to enable easier access to returned error values. All clones share
the same LWP::UserAgent object, so calling C<credentials()> will change the login credentials of all
clones.

=item C<credentials($username, $password, $apihost, $apiurl)>
 
Change the credentials for logging into twitter. This is helpful when managing
multiple accounts.
 
C<apirealm> and C<apihost> are optional and will default to the existing settings if omitted.
 
=item C<http_code>
 
Returns the HTTP response code of the most recent request.
 
=item C<http_message>
 
Returns the HTTP response message of the most recent request.
 
=item C<get_error>
 
If the last request returned an error, the hashref containing the error message can be
retrieved with C<get_error>. This will provide some additional debugging information in
addition to the http code and message above.
 
=back

=head2 SEARCH

As of version 2.00, Net::Twitter implements the search functionality of Twitter,
using code derived from Net::Twitter::Search by Brenda Wallace.

=over

=item C<search()>

Performs a search on http://search.twitter.com for your query string. 

This returns a hashref which is slightly different than the other methods such as public_timeline.
The hashref contains a key named C<results> which contains an arrayref to an array of hashrefs, each
hashref containing a single post. These hashrefs do not include the "user" item with the 
posting user's information such as the *_timeline methods do.

This method takes a required hashref as an argument:

=over

=item C<q>

=item C<query>

REQUIRED: Specifies the string to search for. This can include any of the Twitter search operators listed
at L<http://search.twitter.com/operators>. Please see below for information about backwards compatibility
with Net::Twitter::Search. 

Both q and query are aliases to the same argument. Specifying both will use
the value specified for "query". 

Please note that you cannot use the "near" search operator to specify arbitrary Lat/Long locations. 
For this use the C<geocode> argument below.

=item C<lang>

OPTIONAL: Restricts results to a specific language, given by an ISO 639-1 code. For example {'lang' => 'en'}

=item C<rpp>

OPTIONAL: Sets the number of posts to return per page, up to a max of 100.

=item C<page>

OPTIONAL: Sets the page number (starting at 1) to return, up to a max of roughly 
1500 results (based on rpp * page)

=item C<since_id>

OPTIONAL: Restricts returned posts to those status ids greater than the given id.

=item C<geocode>

OPTIONAL: Returns posts by users located within the radius of the given latitude/longitude, where the user's 
location is taken from their Twitter profile. The format of the parameter value is "latitide,longitude,radius", 
with radius units specified as either "mi" (miles) or "km" (kilometers).

=item C<show_user>

OPTIONAL: When set to a true boolean value C<show_user> will prepend "<username>:" to the beginning of the text of
each post returned.

=back 

=item BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WITH Net::Twitter::Search

In order to maintain backwards compatibility with Net::Twitter::Search, the query/q arguments can be specified
as plain text:

    $res = $twit->search("Farkle McFancypants")

In addition, you can, in this case, specify all of the above arguments in a hashref as the second argument
to the search method.

    $res = $twit->search("Farkle McFancypants", {lang => "en"})
    
Any query/q arguments in the hashref passed in this manner will be ignored, and the module will
proceed using the string passed in the first argument as the query.

=back
 
=head2 HELP METHODS
 
=over
 
=item C<test()>
 
Returns the string "ok" in the requested format with a 200 OK HTTP status
code.
 
=item C<downtime_schedule()>

=head1 AUTHOR

Chris Thompson <cpan@cthompson.com>

The test framework for Net::Twitter was written by Marc "semifor" Mims.

The framework of this module is shamelessly stolen from L<Net::AIML>. Big
ups to Chris "perigrin" Prather for that.
