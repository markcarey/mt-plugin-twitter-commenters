=head1 NAME

Net::Identica - Perl interface to identi.ca

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Net::Identica version 2.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   #!/usr/bin/perl

   use Net::Identica;

   my $ident = Net::Identica->new(username=>"myuser", password=>"mypass" );

   $result = $ident->update(status => "My current Status");

   $ident->credentials("otheruser", "otherpass");

   $result = $ident->update(status => "Status for otheruser");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

identi.ca is a microblogging site similar to twitter.com, and offers up a 
twitter compatible API.

This module wraps L<Net::Twitter>, defaulting to the connection information 
for identica instead of twitter.

All other methods in L<Net::Twitter> work as documented, except where listed 
in the identica / laconica documentation at:

L<http://laconi.ca/trac/wiki/TwitterCompatibleAPI>

=head1 AUTHOR

Chris Thompson <cpan@cthompson.com>

This replaces the original Net::Identica written by Alan Haggai Alavi and uses
the identi.ca/laconi.ca twitter API instead of direct HTML parsing.
